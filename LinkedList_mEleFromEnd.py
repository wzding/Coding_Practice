# In this problem, we are asked to find the element in a singly linked list that's m elements from the end. My idea is to use two pointers â€“ reference pointer and main pointer. We initialize both reference and main pointers to head. First we move reference pointer to n nodes from head, then move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now the main pointer points to nth node from the end. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of linked list. The space complexity is O(1).
